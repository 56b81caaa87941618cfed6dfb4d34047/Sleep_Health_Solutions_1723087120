Following this, the AI provided a checklist of additional features to consider for enhancement, including implementing concise and SEO-friendly URLs, updating the site navigation menu with distinct icons, and adding a dynamic site search feature\u2014among others. The user expressed a desire to rename all tabs to one-word versions. The AI then asked the user two questions regarding the new one-word titles: whether they had specific titles in mind or would prefer suggestions, and if the renaming should reflect a change in navigation hierarchy or simply be for clarity and brevity.\n\nIn a subsequent interaction, the user requested to include an \"About\" tab in the navigation, to which the AI responded with further questions about the positioning of this tab and whether it should lead to a separate page or include a drop-down section. Throughout these exchanges, the AI consistently offered insights and follow-up questions to guide the user in refining their website\u2019s design and functionality.",
